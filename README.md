The stellar-base library is the lowest-level stellar helper library.  It consists of classes
to read, write, hash, and sign the xdr structures that are used in [stellar-core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core).
This is an implementation in JavaScript that can be used on either Node.js or web browsers.

## Quick start

Using npm to include js-stellar-base in your own project:
```shell
npm install --save stellar-base
```

For browsers, [use Bower to install it](#to-use-in-the-browser). It exports a
variable `StellarBase`. The example below assumes you have `stellar-base.js`
relative to your html file.

```html
<script src="stellar-base.js"></script>
<script>console.log(StellarBase);</script>
```

## Install
### Node.js prerequisite
Node.js version 0.10 is required. If you don't have version 0.10, use
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily switch between versions.

### To use as a module in a Node.js project
1. Install it using npm:

  ```shell
  npm install --save stellar-base
  ```
2. require/import it in your JavaScript:

  ```js
  var StellarBase = require('stellar-base');
  ```

### To use in the browser
1. Install it using [bower](http://bower.io):

  ```shell
  bower install stellar-base
  ```

2. Include it in the browser:

  ```html
  <script src="./bower_components/stellar-base/stellar-base.js"></script>
  <script>console.log(StellarBase);</script>
  ```

Note that you can also copy built JS files from [bower-js-stellar-base repo](https://github.com/stellar/bower-js-stellar-base) if you don't want to use Bower.

### To develop and test js-stellar-base itself
1. Clone the repo

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base.git
  ```
2. Install dependencies inside js-stellar-base folder

  ```shell
  cd js-stellar-base
  npm install
  ```
