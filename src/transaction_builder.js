    * <p>Transaction builder helps constructs a new Transaction using the given account
    * as the transaction's "source account". The transaction will use the current sequence
    * number of the given account as its sequence number and increment the given account's
    * sequence number by one. The given source account must include a private key for signing
    * the transaction or an error will be thrown.</p>
    *
    * <p>Operations can be added to the transaction via their corresponding builder methods, and
    * each returns the TransactionBuilder object so they can be chained together. After adding
    * the desired operations, call the build() method on the TransactionBuilder to return a fully
    * constructed Transaction that can be signed. The returned transaction will contain the
    * sequence number of the source account and include the signature from the source account.</p>
    *
    * <p>The following code example creates a new transaction with two payment operations
    * and a changeTrust operation. The Transaction's source account first funds destinationA,
    * then extends a trust line to destination A for a currency, then destinationA sends the
    * source account an amount of that currency. The built transaction would need to be signed by
    * both the source acccount and the destinationA account for it to be valid.</p>
