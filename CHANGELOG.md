  Calling `asset.toString()` will return `native` for `XLM` or `AssetCode:AssetIssuer` for issued assets. See [this PR](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/313) for more information.

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v2.0.2...v2.1.0)

This release adds support for [stellar-core protocol 12 release](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/projects/11) and [CAP 24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0024.md) ("Make PathPayment Symmetrical").

### Add ‚ûï

 - `Operation.pathPaymentStrictSend`: Sends a path payments, debiting from the source account exactly a specified amount of one asset, crediting at least a given amount of another asset. ([#274](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/pull/274)).

    The following operation will debit exactly 10 USD from the source account, crediting at least 9.2 EUR in the destination account üí∏:
    ```js
    var sendAsset = new StellarBase.Asset(
      'USD',
      'GDGU5OAPHNPU5UCLE5RDJHG7PXZFQYWKCFOEXSXNMR6KRQRI5T6XXCD7'
    );
    var sendAmount = '10';
    var destination =
      'GCEZWKCA5VLDNRLN3RPRJMRZOX3Z6G5CHCGSNFHEYVXM3XOJMDS674JZ';
    var destAsset = new StellarBase.Asset(
      'USD',
      'GDGU5OAPHNPU5UCLE5RDJHG7PXZFQYWKCFOEXSXNMR6KRQRI5T6XXCD7'
    );
    var destMin = '9.2';
    var path = [
      new StellarBase.Asset(
        'USD',
        'GBBM6BKZPEHWYO3E3YKREDPQXMS4VK35YLNU7NFBRI26RAN7GI5POFBB'
      ),
      new StellarBase.Asset(
        'EUR',
        'GDTNXRLOJD2YEBPKK7KCMR7J33AAG5VZXHAJTHIG736D6LVEFLLLKPDL'
      )
    ];
    let op = StellarBase.Operation.pathPaymentStrictSend({
      sendAsset,
      sendAmount,
      destination,
      destAsset,
      destMin,
      path
    });
    ```
 - `Operation.pathPaymentStrictReceive`: This behaves the same as the former `pathPayments` operation. ([#274](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/pull/274)).

   The following operation will debit maximum 10 USD from the source account, crediting exactly 9.2 EUR in the destination account  üí∏:
   ```js
   var sendAsset = new StellarBase.Asset(
     'USD',
     'GDGU5OAPHNPU5UCLE5RDJHG7PXZFQYWKCFOEXSXNMR6KRQRI5T6XXCD7'
   );
   var sendMax = '10';
   var destination =
     'GCEZWKCA5VLDNRLN3RPRJMRZOX3Z6G5CHCGSNFHEYVXM3XOJMDS674JZ';
   var destAsset = new StellarBase.Asset(
     'USD',
     'GDGU5OAPHNPU5UCLE5RDJHG7PXZFQYWKCFOEXSXNMR6KRQRI5T6XXCD7'
   );
   var destAmount = '9.2';
   var path = [
     new StellarBase.Asset(
       'USD',
       'GBBM6BKZPEHWYO3E3YKREDPQXMS4VK35YLNU7NFBRI26RAN7GI5POFBB'
     ),
     new StellarBase.Asset(
       'EUR',
       'GDTNXRLOJD2YEBPKK7KCMR7J33AAG5VZXHAJTHIG736D6LVEFLLLKPDL'
     )
   ];
   let op = StellarBase.Operation.pathPaymentStrictReceive({
     sendAsset,
     sendMax,
     destination,
     destAsset,
     destAmount,
     path
   });
   ```

## Deprecated ‚ùóÔ∏è

- `Operation.pathPayment` is being deprecated in favor of `Operation.pathPaymentStrictReceive`. Both functions take the same arguments and behave the same. ([#274](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/pull/274)).

## [v2.0.2](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v2.0.1...v2.0.2)

### Fix
- Fix issue [#269](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/269). ManageBuyOffer should extend BaseOptions and inherited property "source". ([#270](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/pull/270)).

## [v2.0.1](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1)

No changes. Fixes deploy script and includes changes from [v2.0.0](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v1.1.2...v2.0.0).

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v1.1.2...v2.0.0)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Drop Support for Node 6 since it has been end-of-lifed and no longer in LTS. We now require Node 10 which is the current LTS until April 1st, 2021. ([#255](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/pull/255))

## [v1.1.2](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2)

### Fix
- Fix no-network warnings ([#248](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/248))

## [v1.1.1](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1)

### Fix
- Add types for new networkPassphrase argument. Fix [#237](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/237). ([#238](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/238))

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v1.0.3...v1.1.0)

### Deprecated

Deprecate global singleton for `Network`. The following classes and
methods take an optional network passphrase, and issue a warning if it
is not passed:

#### `Keypair.master`

```js
Keypair.master(Networks.TESTNET)
```

#### constructor for `Transaction`

```js
const xenv = new xdr.TransactionEnvelope({ tx: xtx });
new Transaction(xenv, Networks.TESTNET);
```

#### constructor for  `TransactionBuilder` and method `TransactionBuilder.setNetworkPassphrase`

```js
const transaction = new StellarSdk.TransactionBuilder(account, {
  fee: StellarSdk.BASE_FEE,
  networkPassphrase: Networks.TESTNET
})
```

See [#207](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/207) and [#112](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/112) for more information.

The `Network` class will be removed on the `2.0` release.

### Add
- Add docs for BASE_FEE const. ([#211](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/211))

### Fix
- Fix typo. ([#213](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/213))

## [v1.0.3](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.3)

### Add

- Add `toString()` to Asset ([#172](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/172))
- Add types for missing Network functions ([#208](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/208))
- Add BASE_FEE to TS types ([#209](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/209))

### Fix
- Fix typo in types ([#194](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/194))
- Fix types: Fee is no longer optional ([#195](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/195))
- Fix typings for Account Sequence Number ([#203](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/203))
- Fix typings for Transaction Sequence Number ([#205](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/issues/205))

## [v1.0.2](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2)

- Fix a bug where `sodium-native` was making it into the browser bundle, which
  is supposed to use `tweetnacl`.

## [v1.0.1](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)

- Restore `Operation.manageOffer` and `Operation.createPassiveOffer`, and issue
  a warning if they're called.
- Add type definitions for the timeBounds property of transactions.

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v0.13.2...v1.0.0)

- **Breaking change** Stellar Protocol 11 compatibility
  - Rename `Operation.manageOffer` to `Operation.manageSellOffer`.
  - Rename `Operation.createPassiveOffer` to `Operation.createPassiveSellOffer`.
  - Add `Operation.manageBuyOffer`.
- **Breaking change** The `fee` parameter to `TransactionBuilder` is now
  required. Failing to provide a fee will throw an error.

## [v0.13.2](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v0.13.1...v0.13.2)

- Bring DefinitelyTyped definitions into the repo for faster updating.
- Add missing Typescript type definitions.
- Add code to verify signatures when added to transactions.
- Replace ed25519 with sodium-native.
- Fix the xdr for SCP_MESSAGE.
- Update the README for the latest info.

## [v0.13.1](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v0.13.0...v0.13.1)

- Travis: Deploy NPM with an environment variable instead of an encrypted API
  key.
- Instruct Travis to cache node_modules

## [v0.13.0](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0)

- Remove the `crypto` library. This reduces the number of Node built-ins we have
  to shim into the production bundle, and incidentally fixes a bug with
  Angular 6.

## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0)

- _Warning_ Calling TransactionBuilder without a `fee` param is now deprecated
  and will issue a warning. In a later release, it will throw an error. Please
  update your transaction builders as soon as you can!
- Add a `toXDR` function for transactions that lets you get the transaction as a
  base64-encoded string (so you may enter it into the Stellar Laboratory XDR
  viewer, for one)
- Fix TransactionBuilder example syntax errors
- Use more thorough "create account" documentation
- Add `Date` support for `TransactionBuilder` `timebounds`
- Add two functions to `Transaction` that support pre-generated transactions:
  - `getKeypairSignature` helps users sign pre-generated transaction XDRs
  - `addSignature` lets you add pre-generated signatures to a built transaction

## 0.11.0

- Added ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style
- Upgraded dependencies, including Babel to 6
- Bump local node version to 6.14.0
- Change Operations.\_fromXDRAmount to not use scientific notation (1e-7) for
  small amounts like 0.0000001.

## 0.10.0

- **Breaking change** Added
  [`TransactionBuilder.setTimeout`](https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-base/TransactionBuilder.html#setTimeout)
  method that sets `timebounds.max_time` on a transaction. Because of the
  distributed nature of the Stellar network it is possible that the status of
  your transaction will be determined after a long time if the network is highly
  congested. If you want to be sure to receive the status of the transaction
  within a given period you should set the TimeBounds with `maxTime` on the
  transaction (this is what `setTimeout` does internally; if there's `minTime`
  set but no `maxTime` it will be added). Call to
  `TransactionBuilder.setTimeout` is required if Transaction does not have
  `max_time` set. If you don't want to set timeout, use `TimeoutInfinite`. In
  general you should set `TimeoutInfinite` only in smart contracts. Please check
  [`TransactionBuilder.setTimeout`](https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-base/TransactionBuilder.html#setTimeout)
  docs for more information.
- Fixed decoding empty `homeDomain`.

## 0.9.0

- Update `js-xdr` to support unmarshaling non-utf8 strings.
- String fields returned by `Operation.fromXDRObject()` are of type `Buffer` now
  (except `SetOptions.home_domain` and `ManageData.name` - both required to be
  ASCII by stellar-core).

## 0.8.3

- Update `xdr` files to V10.

## 0.8.2

- Upgrade `js-xdr`.

## 0.8.1

- Removed `src` from `.npmignore`.

## 0.8.0

- Updated docs.

## 0.7.6

- Updated docs.

## 0.7.5

- `Keypair.constructor` now requires `type` field to define public-key signature
  system used in this instance (so `Keypair` can support other systems in a
  future). It also checks if public key and secret key match if both are passed
  (to prevent nasty bugs).
- `Keypair.fromRawSeed` has been renamed to `Keypair.fromRawEd25519Seed` to make
  it clear that the seed must be Ed25519 seed.
- It's now possible to instantiate `Memo` class so it's easier to check it's
  type and value (without dealing with low level `xdr.Memo` objects).
- Changed `Asset.toXdrObject` to `Asset.toXDRObject` and
  `Operation.operationToObject` to `Operation.toXDRObject` for consistency.
- Time bounds support for numeric input values.
- Added `browser` prop to package.json.

## 0.7.4

- Update dependencies.
- Remove unused methods.

## 0.7.3

- Allow hex string in setOptions signers

- `StrKey` helper class with `strkey` encoding related methods.
- Removed deprecated methods: `Keypair.isValidPublicKey` (use `StrKey`),
  `Keypair.isValidSecretKey` (use `StrKey`), `Keypair.fromSeed`, `Keypair.seed`,
  `Keypair.rawSeed`.
- **Breaking changes**:
  - `Network` must be explicitly selected. Previously testnet was a default
    network.
  - `Operation.setOptions()` method `signer` param changed.
  - `Keypair.fromAccountId()` renamed to `Keypair.fromPublicKey()`.
  - `Keypair.accountId()` renamed to `Keypair.publicKey()`.
  - Dropping support for `End-of-Life` node versions.

- Fixed Lodash registering itself to global scope.

## 0.5.3

- Add support for ManageData operation.

## 0.5.2

- Moved `Account.isValidAccountId` to `Keypair.isValidPublicKey`. It's still
  possible to use `Account.isValidAccountId` but it will be removed in the next
  minor release (breaking change). (af10f2a)
- `signer.address` option in `Operation.setOptions` was changed to
  `signer.pubKey`. It's still possible to use `signer.address` but it will be
  removed in the next minor release (breaking change). (07f43fb)

## 0.5.1

- Now it's possible to pass `price` params as `{n: numerator, d: denominator}`
  object. Thanks @FredericHeem. (#73)

## 0.5.0

- **Breaking change** `sequence` in `Account` constructor must be a string.
  (4da5dfc)
- **Breaking change** Removed deprecated methods (180a5b8):
  - `Account.isValidAddress` (replaced by `Account.isValidAccountId`)
  - `Account.getSequenceNumber` (replaced by `Account.sequenceNumber`)
